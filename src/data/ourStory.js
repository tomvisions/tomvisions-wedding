The \"Tom Voodoo\" vibes were intense leading to canoeing, camping and a variety of other activities that Vanessa would never have imagined. Even a sprained ankle would not stop our fun...LOL",

The rescue sled ride down the hill was something to remember, with Tom being extra careful with his precious cargo. Next came snowshoeing, taking a nice long walk, in -15 degrees Celsius weather. What could be better?",

Tom had to do some creative scheming, enlisting the help of his future mother-in-law and Vanessa's friend Tiffany to pull it off. Tom's stress levels were high, but a few strawberry daiquiris helped soothe his nerves. When the big moment came, he forgot what he wanted to say, and Vanessa was stunned into silence, but he got the right answer.",
